# Simulation

## Things to consider
- The probability that someone will infect someone else and vice versa
- Individual groups of people
- How people will actually infect one another
- How multiple groups will be managed asynchronously
- Speed of contation
- How to actually begin the pandemic (e.g where will it start, who will start it)
- Options for starting the simulation

## Start options
- How vulnerable the people are
- What percentage of the population is vulnerable

## Probability that a unit will be infected given its vulnerability
Let the user determine how a person will be infected. This software should be flexible.
